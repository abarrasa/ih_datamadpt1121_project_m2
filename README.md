## __Challenge 1: Data Exploration and Preparation__

The source of the database for the __exploratory analysis__ is SQL database [__diamonds_m2.db__](https://github.com/ih-datapt-mad/ih_datamadpt1121_project_m2/blob/main/db/diamonds_m2.db). Once the final dataset was done, with `pandas`  library, we export it as a `.xlsx` to make an analysis in a visualization tool.

## **Challenge 2: BI Report/Dashboard**

To visualize the data, we used **Power BI** tool, where, with some filters, you can obtain conclusions about diamond`s features.

In the `Units` sheet, there are some graphics and a world map. Here you can observe, using graphics as filter, the amount of diamonds depending on the selected variables like cut, color, cities, and clarity. 

In the other sheet, `Price` , the filters show the different prices of these diamonds according to color, clarity, carats and cut.
